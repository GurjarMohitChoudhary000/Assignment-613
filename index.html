        HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the most basic building block of the
        Web. It defines the meaning and structure of web content. Other
        technologies besides HTML are generally used to describe a web page's
        appearance/presentation (CSS) or functionality/behavior (JavaScript).
      </p>
      <p>
        "Hypertext" refers to links that connect web pages to one another,
        either within a single website or between websites. Links are a
        fundamental aspect of the Web. By uploading content to the Internet and
        linking it to pages created by other people, you become an active
        participant in the World Wide Web.
      </p>
      <p>
        HTML uses "markup" to annotate text, images, and other content for
        display in a Web browser. HTML markup includes special "elements" such
        as head, title, body, header, footer, article, section, p, div, span,
        img, aside, audio, canvas, datalist, details, embed, nav, output,
        progress, video, ul, ol, li and many others.
      </p>
      <p>
        An HTML element is set off from other text in a document by "tags",
        which consist of the element name surrounded by "<" and ">". The name of
        an element inside a tag is case insensitive. That is, it can be written
        in uppercase, lowercase, or a mixture. For example, the title tag can be
        written as Title, TITLE, or in any other way.
      </p>
      <h1>Basic sections of a document</h1>
      <p>
        Webpages can and will look pretty different from one another, but they
        all tend to share similar standard components, unless the page is
        displaying a fullscreen video or game, is part of some kind of art
        project, or is just badly structured:
      </p>
      <dl>
        <dt>Header:</dt>
        <dd>
          Usually a big strip across the top with a big heading, logo, and
          perhaps a tagline. This usually stays the same from one webpage to
          another.
        </dd>
        <dt>Navigation Bar:</dt>
        <dd>
          Links to the site's main sections; usually represented by menu
          buttons, links, or tabs. Like the header, this content usually remains
          consistent from one webpage to another â€” having inconsistent
          navigation on your website will just lead to confused, frustrated
          users. Many web designers consider the navigation bar to be part of
          the header rather than an individual component, but that's not a
          requirement; in fact, some also argue that having the two separate is
          better for accessibility, as screen readers can read the two features
          better if they are separate.
        </dd>
        <dt>Main Content:</dt>
        <dd>
          A big area in the center that contains most of the unique content of a
          given webpage, for example, the video you want to watch, or the main
          story you're reading, or the map you want to view, or the news
          headlines, etc. This is the one part of the website that definitely
          will vary from page to page!
        </dd>
        <dt>Sidebar:</dt>
        <dd>
          Some peripheral info, links, quotes, ads, etc. Usually, this is
          contextual to what is contained in the main content (for example on a
          news article page, the sidebar might contain the author's bio, or
          links to related articles) but there are also cases where you'll find
          some recurring elements like a secondary navigation system.
        </dd>
        <dt>Footer</dt>
        <dd>
          A strip across the bottom of the page that generally contains fine
          print, copyright notices, or contact info. It's a place to put common
          information (like the header) but usually, that information is not
          critical or secondary to the website itself. The footer is also
          sometimes used for SEO purposes, by providing links for quick access
          to popular content.
